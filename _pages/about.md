Hello! I'm **Dr. Reeshad Khan**, a dedicated researcher specializing in **deep learning**, **autonomous systems**, and **medical imaging**. My passion lies in pushing the boundaries of **unsupervised learning**, **model optimization**, and **GPU acceleration** to develop efficient solutions for both *autonomous vehicles* and *healthcare* applications. 

I strive to leverage cutting-edge techniques that enhance real-time scene understanding, medical image processing, and advanced driver-assistance systems. Throughout my academic journey, I've been involved in numerous **research projects**â€”ranging from **semantic scene understanding** for self-driving cars to **MRI denoising methods** for medical diagnostics. 

Feel free to explore my other pages for more details on **projects**, **publications**, or upcoming **news**. If you're interested in potential collaborations or just want to talk about the exciting world of AI, I'd be delighted to connect!
